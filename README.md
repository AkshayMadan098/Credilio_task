# news_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Further Improvements:
Model Implementation:

- Implement models to parse and store API data efficiently.
- This would improve the code structure by clearly defining the data types and ensuring type safety.

State Management:

- Implement state management (e.g., using Provider or GetX) to handle the app's state.
- This would separate the business logic from the UI, leading to cleaner code and better scalability.
- Proper state management would also enhance performance by efficiently managing widget rebuilds.
